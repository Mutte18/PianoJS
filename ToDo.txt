---New functionality ideas---

# Implement a Accord mode and Single key mode with 2 toggle buttons at top of screen (THE CSS HAS TO BE DONE WITH IT)

# The accord will be shown as three notes on a note sheet

# Add new images of the notes which all have the same size

# When you fail a chord, it should show you the correct keys, and then make you try again, until you
  complete it

#


---Improving on existing functionality---
# You should not be able to get the same note two times in a row
# The switching of images should be seemless and should not flash
# Add images of all existing keys (the lower and higher notes aswell as the f notes)
# Add the new notes to the pool of keys to be queried
# Add options as to which keys you want to train for (All, lower, mid, upper etc)

# When not in chord mode, this counter should not be visible
# When at the chord limit, hover on keys should be removed. Only if hovering over a selected should
  it be visible. This is to improve on UX and user feedback (THE SOLUTION TO THIS COULD BE IMPROVED)

# ADD DOMStrings TO EVERYTHING, BEFORE IT BECOMES A BIGGER MESS THAN IT IS!

# The single key query method needs to updated and split into UI, Sound, Pianohandler files etc


---Improving on CSS---
# The piano keys should look fancier, with a more shadowed look(?)
# When pressing down on the keys it should be visible (Inspiration can be taken from
(https://www.apronus.com/music/flashpiano.htm)
# A good looking background somehow, something clean and simple
#


---Thoughts and Reflections---
# When guessing a chord, should the correct chord be played, or the keys chosen?
