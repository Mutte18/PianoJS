---New functionality ideas---

# Implement a Accord mode and Single key mode with 2 toggle buttons at top of screen (THE CSS HAS TO BE DONE WITH IT)

# The accord will be shown as three notes on a note sheet

# Add a new class for Sounds that the key makes. Get the key clicked and send in
  and play the note. These sounds will have to be recorded. As well as the accords

# Separate the js code to a UI class, a Sound class, a Functionality class

# Add new images of the notes which all have the same size

# Potentially add a free play mode where you can just play the notes without query

# Determine the chords that should be available to be chosen and what keys are in
each chord


---Improving on existing functionality---
# You should not be able to get the same note two times in a row
# The switching of images should be seemless and should not flash
# Add images of all existing keys (the lower and higher notes aswell as the f notes)
# Add the new notes to the pool of keys to be queried
# Add options as to which keys you want to train for (All, lower, mid, upper etc)


---Improving on CSS---
# The piano keys should look fancier, with a more shadowed look(?)
# A good looking background somehow, something clean and simple
#
